**My Deep Work** is a web app that helps to **plan and execute** your workdays, tasks, projects, and dreams.

You can

- Manage your tasks
- Plan and prioritize your day
- Analyze how you spend your work time
- Focus on the most important and keep progressing

### Recommended approach

The idea is to **plan blocks of time for big tasks** instead of micromanaging and scheduling miriads of tiny tasks. Other tools like [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) are doing it better.

- Add **high-level big tasks** that cover distinct work streams or areas:
  - Projects
  - Work activities
  - Study topics
  - Routine groups (morning, evening, exercise)
  - Smaller task groups (home chores)
- Put details or steps that you need to do in the **task's briefing** section.
- Automatically or manually **plan time blocks** for each task.
- Once the task started, work on it to the best ability without interruptions.
- Re-plan day tasks to **maximize your score** as your work day unleashes and brings surprises.
- Save common tasks and schedules for the day as **templates**.

## Tasks

Task has several properties:

- **Name**
- **Task Brief** - details or steps of what should be done
- **Planned time** in minutes (default)
- **Break time** after a task is done
- **Progress** (use any units - %, pages, steps) and total estimation
- **Score Boost** - multiplier of task time based on the value for your life (1 is regular, 10 - life-changing, 0.1 - little value).
  - `Score = minutes * score boost`
- **Color**

Save task for the day (each day keeps its own version) or sync with your **Task DB** to use for upcoming days.

You can use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for Task Name and Brief content.

## Day Tasks

Add tasks from **Task DB** to the day.

- Reorder tasks
- Enter planned time and breaks
- Split tasks into different sessions

Move between days

You can always sync task content and progress if you had changes in Task DB

### Day Templates

Load and save day templates to avoid manual planning. A template includes day tasks, available, and manually scheduled time.

> You can have partial templates and load one by one (e.g. morning block, afternoon, day of week, office / home)

## Day Plan & Map

Day plan dynamically builds your day schedule based on tasks order, planned time.
You can see your real-time schedule in **Day Map** panel.

Enter **available time** blocks. All tasks will fill available time in your order.

**Re-plan** as needed: change tasks order or manually assign time intervals by clicking on the task and time block start and end.

**Task Brief**
Update task brief on the go. Save for day only or also in Task DB

**Progress**
Track progress for tasks that have a finish line

## Task Execution

Start, pause, or complete tasks from the task card or **control bar** below the screen.

### Day at Glance

Assess your day situation. The system will estimate execution probability based on your plan and your history.
In addition, you can see the value of your day based on the score and completed tasks.

You can aslo see your day status on the sidebar or schedule tab
